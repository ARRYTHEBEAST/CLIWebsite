#CLIWebsit

Ever since i started getting to know CLI i have been fascinated and straight up enchanted by the simplicity and the unique sensation that it gives. It often feels like the only OS that i would truly ever llove would be the one where everything is the terminal. Therefore to express my love for the terminal i made this website into a terminal.

However, this website serves as my portfolio and as a playground to express my creativity.
